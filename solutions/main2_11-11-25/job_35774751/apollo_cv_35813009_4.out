 Final LL: Starting Part 3 (Cross-validation + Remaining): MXL1k_none_wtp 
Starting Cross-Validation
Testing likelihood function.
5 separate runs will be conducted, each using a random subset of 80% of
  individuals for estimation, and the remainder for validation.
Number of individuals
- for estimation : 587
- for forecasting : 147
- in sample (total): 734
Estimated parameters and log-likelihoods for each sample will be
  written to:
  logs/job_35774751/MXL1k_none_wtp/MXL1k_none_wtp_outOfSample_params.csv
The matrix defining the observations used in each repetition will be
  written to:
  logs/job_35774751/MXL1k_none_wtp/MXL1k_none_wtp_outOfSample_samples.csv
